# Lighthouse

In the quiet moments after loss, when the world feels overwhelming and the heart is heavy, there is light. Lighthouse is here to be that light—a gentle companion walking beside you during one of life's most difficult journeys.

## With Compassion, Not Complexity

We believe that when you're grieving, you shouldn't have to navigate complex systems or remember countless details. Lighthouse was created to lift that burden, offering a warm hand to hold during a time when you need it most.

### More Than an App, It's a Companion

**For your loved one's memory:**
- ✨ Create meaningful farewell celebrations that reflect their unique spirit
- 📝 Capture stories and memories that will be treasured for generations
- 🎵 Guide thoughtful ceremonies that comfort and bring peace

**For your well-being:**
- 🌅 Prioritize your needs with a brain-fog aware task system

## When You Feel Like You're Alone

You're not. Lighthouse was built with deep compassion for the human experience of loss. It doesn't replace the care of friends and family—it helps you extend that care more effectively.

Each feature comes from listening to those who've walked this path before you. We've learned that organization and compassion aren't opposites—they work together to create space for healing.

## A Space for Remembering

At its heart, Lighthouse is about creating space. Space to grieve, to remember, to celebrate, and to begin healing. We provide the structure so you can focus on what matters most: honoring your loved one and caring for yourself and your family.

Because when you're navigating loss, you deserve a light to guide you—not another thing to worry about. 💙
